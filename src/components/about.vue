    <h2>about me</h2>
    <h3>it & school</h3>
    <p>
      currently, I'm studying at <strong>kantonsschule b√ºelrain</strong>, where I'm mostly focused on economics and law. At <strong>berufsschule winterthur (bbw)</strong> and <strong>zli</strong>, I'm diving into various it topics like networking, java, and different frameworks, alongside management skills and <strong>many more</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      outside of school, I'm all about personal projects, especially <strong>web development</strong>. I love <strong>designing</strong> websites, especially the frontend part.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm always eager to learn and explore new things in the it world, constantly striving to <strong>improve</strong> my skills.
    </p>

    <h3>private life</h3>
    <p>
      when it comes to myself, i enjoy <strong>hiking</strong>, particularly during spring and summer seasons. nature holds a special place in my heart. additionally, i have an interest in <strong>photography</strong> and often carry my <strong>camera</strong> with me to capture various scenes, including landscapes, night skies, and moments with friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      staying active is important to me, so i regularly go to the <strong>gym</strong> and occasionally go jogging. i've also been practicing <strong>karate</strong> for nearly <strong>14 years</strong>, attending weekly training sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      as a person, i'm naturally curious and enjoy learning new things. <strong>communication</strong> is one of my strengths; i find it easy to engage in <strong>conversations</strong> with people, including strangers. i'm comfortable working both <strong>independently</strong> and in group settings. <strong>flexibility</strong> is a trait i value; i can quickly <strong>adjust</strong> my schedule to accommodate new tasks or opportunities.
    </p>

        <img src="@/assets/images/vsco.png" alt="VSCO Icon" class="social-icon" />
        <p>
          on <strong>vsco</strong>, I share a variety of images that I personally find appealing. what I appreciate about <strong>vsco</strong> is the minimalistic layout of my profile and the fact that all images are perfectly sized.
